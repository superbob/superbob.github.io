With this app you can see your last breastfeeds, know where you are (quick last breastfeed info), and record new breastfeeds.

I developed it with Yeoman/AngularJS, Mavan/SpringMVC and Google App Engine (Web server + Datastore).

Installation instructions [here](https://github.com/superbob/tetedotout/blob/master/README.md#installation).
